example using FullMonte with AMBER force field and atomic charges from B3LYP/6-31G*

INPUT:
% FullMonte13 methylethylether.com methylethylether.params

options selected:
o  Use CPCM solvation ? (Y/N) n

o  MCMM (Y) or SUMM (N) ? (Y/N) y


OUTPUT:
logfile methylethylether_fm.log summarizes results

outfile methylethylether_fm.out can be opened with GaussView (select "view intermediate structures", they are ordered in terms of energy)

pdbfile methylethylether_fm.pdb can be opened with PyMol (again they are ordered in terms of energy)
