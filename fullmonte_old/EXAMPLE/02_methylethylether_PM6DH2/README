example using FullMonte with PM6 Hamiltonian with dispersion and H-bonding correction
N.B. increased RMS value in torsion angles to 30 degrees above which conformers are deemed to be non-identical

INPUT:
% FullMonte13 methylethylether.com methylethylether.params

options selected:
o  Use COSMO solvation ? (Y/N) y

   Enter solvent dielectric constant (default = 78.4) 4


OUTPUT:
logfile methylethylether_fm.log summarizes results

outfile methylethylether_fm.out can be opened with GaussView (select "view intermediate structures", they are ordered in terms of energy)

pdbfile methylethylether_fm.pdb can be opened with PyMol (again they are ordered in terms of energy)
